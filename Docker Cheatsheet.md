# 🐳 The Definitive Docker Professional Cheatsheet

## 1. Core Concepts & Architecture

- **Containers vs. Virtual Machines**: Each VM uses its own guest OS, whereas **all Docker containers share a single host OS kernel**, making them more lightweight
- **Images vs. Containers**: An **image** is a read-only package (blueprint); a **container** is a running instance of that package.
- **The Docker Engine**: Consists of a background service (**Docker Daemon**), a **REST API** for communication, and the **Docker CLI** used for commands.
- **Layered Architecture**: Images are built in stacked **read-only layers**; once a container runs, it adds a thin **read-write layer** on top.
- **Copy-On-Write (CoW)**: When a container modifies a file from the image, it copies the file to the top read-write layer before making changes, leaving the original image layer untouched.

## 2. Essential Commands Reference

### Lifecycle & Operations

|Command|Description|Optimization Tip|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`docker run`|Create and start a container.|Use `--rm` to auto-delete containers on exit.|
|`docker stop`|Gracefully shut down a container.|Use `docker kill` for immediate, forceful stops.|
|`docker ps -a`|List **all** containers (running and stopped).|Crucial for finding "ghost" containers taking up space.|
|`docker exec -it`|Run an interactive command inside a running container.|Best for debugging live environments.|
|`docker logs -f`|Stream container output/logs in real-time.|Use to monitor application startup errors.|

### System Maintenance

- **`docker system df`**: Show real-time disk usage by Docker objects.
- **`docker system prune`**: Remove all unused containers, networks, and dangling images.
- **`docker system prune -a --volumes`**: **High Danger.** Clears everything, including all unused images and all volumes.

## 3. Storage: Volumes & Bind Mounts

Docker data is non-persistent unless mapped to the host system. By default, data is stored in `/var/lib/docker` on Linux.

- **Named Volumes**: Managed by Docker. Best for database persistence.
    - `docker volume create <name>`
    - `docker run -v my_vol:/app/data`
- **Bind Mounts**: Maps a specific host directory to a container. Best for source code sharing during dev.
    - `docker run -v /host/path:/container/path`
- **Modern Optmized Syntax**: Use `--mount` for better readability and explicit control.
    - `docker run --mount type=bind,source=/data,target=/var/lib/mysql`

## 4. Networking Drivers

|Driver|Behavior|Use Case|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Bridge**|Default network; containers get internal IPs.|Standard isolated app communication.|
|**Host**|Removes isolation between container and host network.|Maximum performance; no port mapping needed.|
|**None**|No external or internal network connectivity.|Highly secure, offline batch processing.|
|**User-defined**|Custom bridge network with **Embedded DNS**.|Allows containers to talk via **Container Name**.|

## 5. Dockerfile Optimization Patterns

### CMD vs. ENTRYPOINT

- **`ENTRYPOINT ["executable"]`**: Defines the command that **always runs** at startup.
- **`CMD ["param"]`**: Provides **default arguments** for the entrypoint; easily overridden by CLI arguments.
    - _Pattern_: `ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]` + `CMD ["5"]` allows `docker run img` to sleep for 5s, while `docker run img 10` sleeps for 10s.

### Best Practices for Seniors

- **Minimize Layers**: Combine `RUN` commands (e.g., `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install...`) to reduce image size.
- **Security**: Always define a **non-root user** in the Dockerfile to prevent container-breakout vulnerabilities.
- **Resource Constraints**: Prevent one container from crashing the host by limiting CPU and RAM.
    - `docker run --cpus=".5" --memory="100m" ubuntu`

---
## 6. Resource Management & Constraints

To prevent a single container from crashing the entire host, always define resource limits.

• **Limit CPU**: `docker run --cpus=0.5 ubuntu` (Limits container to 50% of one CPU core).

• **Limit Memory**: `docker run --memory=500m ubuntu` (Restricts memory usage to 500 MB).

• **Real-time Monitoring**: Use `docker stats` to view live CPU and memory utilization across all containers.

## 7. Common Mistakes & Fixes

### Junior Mistakes

1. **Port Mapping Confusion**: Forgetting that the mapping is `-p <HostPort>:<ContainerPort>`. Mapping a host port already in use results in a "Bind failure" error.
2. **Dangling Data**: Using `docker rm` but forgetting that **volumes remain** on the disk, slowly filling up storage.
3. **Dependent Images**: Attempting to `docker rmi` an image while a container (even a stopped one) is still using it.

### Senior/Optimization Failures

1. **Hardcoding IPs**: Using internal container IPs instead of **User-defined Bridge networks** with DNS resolution.
2. **Missing Healthchecks**: Not using the `HEALTHCHECK` instruction, leading to "running" containers that are actually dead inside.
3. **Thick Images**: Using a full OS (Ubuntu) as a base instead of **Alpine** or **Hardened Images** for production.

## 8. Docker Compose & Swarm (Orchestration)

- **Docker Compose**: Used to run multi-container applications (Services, Networks, Volumes) via a `.yml` file.
    - `docker compose up -d`
- **Docker Swarm**: A cluster of Docker Engines. Use `docker swarm init` to create a manager and `docker swarm join` for workers.
    - **Services**: In Swarm, you create **Services** instead of individual containers to allow for scaling.
    - `docker service create --replicas=3 my-app`

---
## 9. The Dockerfile Reference

|Instruction|Purpose|
|:--|:--|
|`FROM`|Defines the **base image** (e.g., Ubuntu, Python).|
|`RUN`|Executes commands during the **build process** to install dependencies.|
|`COPY`|Copies files/folders from the host to the image.|
|`WORKDIR`|Sets the **working directory** for subsequent instructions.|
|`ENV`|Sets environment variables within the image.|
|`EXPOSE`|Informs Docker that the container listens on specific ports.|
|`ENTRYPOINT`|Specifies the **command that will always run** at startup.|
|`CMD`|Provides **default arguments** for the entrypoint (can be overridden).|

**Analogy for Recall**: Imagine a **Shipping Port**. 
An **Image** is a standardized blueprint for a crate; 
a **Registry** is the global warehouse of blueprints; a **Container** is the physical crate being moved by the crane (**Docker Engine**). 
If you don't use a **Volume**, it's like a crate that is incinerated the moment you unpack it—anything inside that wasn't written down on the **Host Dock** is lost forever.
